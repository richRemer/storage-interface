storage-interface
=================
Inspired by the Web Storage API.

Common storage interfaces for Node.js modules.  Implement only the parts you
need and which are supported by the underlying storage.  Mix and match various
features and provide a common mechanism for consumer apps to inspect storage
capabilities and merge data providers.
